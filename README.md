# Deep-Weighted-Guided-Upsampling-Network-for-Depth-of-Field-Image-Upsampling

The official implementation of paper "Deep Weighted Guided Upsampling Network for Depth of Field Image Upsampling"

## Environment introduction

### Hardware

```command
CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8700K
GPU: GTX 1080
RAM: 8G*2 2666
```

### Python

```command
torchvision==0.7.0+cu101
torch==1.6.0+cu101
opencv_python==4.4.0.46
numpy==1.18.5
scikit_image==0.18.1
Pillow==8.1.1
skimage==0.0
```

## Dataset

[Baidu](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Ap6fUxGO0OcIXTmDjPmOWg?pwd=4ca5), code: 4ca5

## Model

The pretrained model is already uploaded in repo, `./model/DWGUN.pth`

## Training

Customize the `trainConfig` in `train.py` and run it

```python
python train.py
```

## Testing

Customize the `evalPngConfig` in `test.py` and run it

```python
python test.py
```

In `test.py`, you can use `testAllInOne` to test x2/x4/x8 for both shallow & deep testing dataset at one time. Or use `evalPng` to test the selected scale.
